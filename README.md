# Capacitor-Charging-and-Discharging-Simulation
This project simulates the charging and discharging behavior of a capacitor in an RC circuit. It helps visualize time-dependent behavior of voltage using numerical methods and plots.
# Capacitor Charging and Discharging Simulation

This Python project simulates the charging and discharging of a capacitor in an RC circuit. It uses numerical methods to show voltage over time and helps visualize capacitor behavior.

## How to Run

1. Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Run the simulation:
python rc_circuit.py
